I built this website as a way to practice the HTML skills I've learnt through the HTML section of The Odin Project Foundations path. I created a landing page with links to all the different recipes on the website. I also later went back and added some more styling to the pages using CSS after learning basic CSS through the following section of The Odin Project.

Each page features an image of the food, a short description, a list of ingredients, and a list of steps.
